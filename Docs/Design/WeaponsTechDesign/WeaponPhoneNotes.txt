projectile thoughts

Mon 27 May 2024

I am going to be really stupid/naive with projectile init.

weapon owners init weapons with collision layer and aiming nature as desired.

when shooting, weapon owners will pass along their initial velocity, if any, as part of the shoot function
	or maybe a velocity access callable as part of weapon init?

weapons will initialize projectile with initial velocity and collision layers in instance

both projectiles and weapons will get a VB super class to act as interfaces for this. They'll essentially do nothing besides offering these init functions. this  might allow me to move some functionality from the current stubs into a superclass for reuse later
