What's the absolute basics of Vagobond?

[ ] Player Character
	[*] Move with WASD
	[*] Aim with Mouse
	[ ] Shoot Projectiles
[ ] Health Functionality
[ ] Projectile Nodes
	[ ] Projectile Movers
[ ] Enemy Nodes
[ ] Weapon Assets
	* It'd be cool if weapons were data-driven assets. Hmm... What if they could be imported via a spreadsheet? I'll worry about that later.
	* Now that I think about this, this is just a more involved FIREBALL... time to steal some assets!
[ ] Enemies
	[ ] Infantry Squads
	[ ] Tanks
	[ ] Rival Mechs
[ ] Basic Enemy, Weapon, Player, and Background Sprites
[ ] Basic Music and Sounds


What things still need to be thought about or designed?
[ ] How do weapons, projectiles, those shooting them, and those getting hit by them interact?
[ ] What is the inheritence relationship between playable and non-playable units? Is there any?
	* I want certain mechs to be pilotable by either players or AI, but maybe that's a feature to figure out later. Yeah..
	* After all, I don't even have AI mechs that act like players yet, so who cares? I'll refactor it later.
