What's the absolute basics of Vagobond?

[*] Player Character
	[*] Move with WASD
	[*] Aim with Mouse
	[*] Shoot Projectiles
[ ] Refactor Player Character into VB classes/into reusable aggregate behavior classes
[ ] Health Functionality
[*] Projectile Scene
	[*] Movement Callable
	[*] Collision Callable
[ ] Enemy Nodes
[ ] Weapon Assets
	* It'd be cool if weapons were data-driven assets. Hmm... What if they could be imported via a spreadsheet? I'll worry about that later.
	* Now that I think about this, this is just a more involved FIREBALL... time to steal some assets!
[ ] Enemies
	[ ] Infantry Squads
	[ ] Tanks
	[ ] Rival Mechs
[ ] Basic Enemy, Weapon, Player, and Background Sprites
[ ] Basic Music and Sounds

What unforseen things have come up?
[ ] How should the shooter's velocity be added to a shot projectile's velocity? not all projectiles will be hitscan
	* Well, in real life, the projectile would just go that much faster. conservation of momentum and all that...
	* also, moving things don't have inherent "velocity" attributes, I think? Well, maybe bodies do. So a shooter can get a speed thing to work with
	
What things still need to be thought about or designed?
[ ] How do weapons, projectiles, those shooting them, and those getting hit by them interact?
	[ ] Collision Layer Definitions
	[ ] What do some people do for shooter interactions?
[*] How should projectiles be composited? how much of their functionality should come from composites, and how much should come from inherited scene structure?
[ ] What is the inheritence relationship between playable and non-playable units? Is there any?
	* I want certain mechs to be pilotable by either players or AI, but maybe that's a feature to figure out later. Yeah..
	* After all, I don't even have AI mechs that act like players yet, so who cares? I'll refactor it later.
