====== FunctionalityWithoutSuperClasses ======
Created Monday 20 May 2024

I'm going to write my super classes as I go. The following nodes are high-level functionality nodes (like scene parents) that don't have super classes. This list is meant to track classes so I can call out when/if I should make super classes for them.

* OverlapAndDamageCallable - Inherits Area2D, collides with things, damages them, and then emits a signal that damage has been dealt
